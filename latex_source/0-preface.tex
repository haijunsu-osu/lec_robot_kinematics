\section{Preface}

\vspace{1 cm}


This is an unofficial summary of the robot kinematics lectures on \textit{Robot Kinematics} at The Ohio State University.\\ 

We aim to cover all the content from the exercises and supplement it with explanations from the book \textit{Introduction to Robotics - Mechanics and Control (3rd ed.)} by John J. Craig. Much of the lecture notes are by the professors Philipp Wulff and Jan Hansen-Palmus from the Technical University of Munich \href{https://github.com/philippwulff/TUM_RCI}{GitHub repository} . And the original content of their lecture notes is based on the Stanford lecture \textit{Introduction to Robotics} by professor Oussama Khatib, which you can watch on \href{https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL65CC0384A1798ADF}{YouTube}. Many of the figures in this summary are direct screenshots of his slides. Note, that the notations are not consistent throughout this summary.\\
