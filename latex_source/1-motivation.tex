%\subsection{Types of joints}
\textbf{Joints} usually have motion/position sensors, allowing to measure their relative position to neighboring links. The figure below shows some commonly used kinematic joints~\cite{Waldron2016}. \\

The \textbf{end-effector} is located at the end of the chain of links that make up the manipulator. Different types of joints connect the links of a manipulator~\cite{Waldron2016}.
